Recommendations

-- Targeted Product Development:

Focus on developing premium and exclusive products for higher-educated and high-income consumers, particularly in wine and fruit categories. For lower-educated and lower-income segments, create budget-friendly options or value packs to cater to their spending behaviors.
Personalized Pricing Strategies:

-- Implement tiered pricing strategies based on customer segments. 

For high-income segments, maintain premium pricing for quality products, while offering competitive pricing and discounts for budget-conscious consumers to increase their engagement and spending.

-- Enhanced Online Marketing Campaigns:

Since younger consumers (18-34) show lower engagement, develop targeted online marketing campaigns that leverage social media platforms. Use engaging content and promotions to increase their interest and drive sales through online channels.


--Re-engagement Initiatives for Inactive Customers:

Design tailored re-engagement campaigns aimed at inactive customers, highlighting new products, exclusive offers, and personalized communications to entice them back. Monitor the effectiveness of these campaigns closely to optimize outreach strategies.
