# Customer Personality Analysis

Our company has collected comprehensive customer data to better understand our ideal customers.

## Questions to Answer Using the 4 Ps Framework

- Are there specific demographics that tend to spend more on premium products versus budget options?

### **Price**
- How does the average spending on products vary with different income levels and education backgrounds?
- What percentage of customers respond positively to promotional discounts, and how does this affect their overall spending?
- How can we adjust pricing strategies to better align with customer price sensitivity and willingness to pay?

### **Place**
- Which sales channels (online, catalog, in-store) are most frequently used by different customer segments?
- How do the number of web visits correlate with online purchases, and what does this indicate about our website's effectiveness?

### **Promotion**
- What are the acceptance rates for our marketing campaigns, and which campaigns are most effective for specific customer segments?
- How do complaints and purchase recency impact customer engagement with our promotional efforts?
- What types of promotions yield the highest conversion rates among different demographics, and how can we leverage this information for future campaigns?
