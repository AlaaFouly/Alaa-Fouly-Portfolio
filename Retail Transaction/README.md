# Retail Transaction Data Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze retail transaction data to uncover key insights about customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. Based on the analysis, we aim to recommend strategies for targeting key customer segments, optimizing product offerings, and increasing overall sales by 20% over the next two quarters.

## Key Questions

   - Which age group generated the highest revenue in the dataset, and how can we leverage this information to create targeted marketing strategies?

2. **Revenue by Gender**
   - How does the total revenue from female customers compare to male customers, and what opportunities exist to engage with these segments?

3. **Product Category Performance**
   - Which product categories contributed the most to overall revenue, and what trends can we observe in the sales of Electronics, Clothing, and Beauty products?

4. **Price vs. Quantity Sold**
   - What is the relationship between product price per unit and the quantity sold? How can we adjust pricing to maximize sales without reducing overall revenue?

5. **Seasonal Trends**
   - How do sales trends vary across different months for each product category? What time of the year should we focus on promotions for Electronics, Clothing, and Beauty products?
