-- Strategic Recommendations

- Focus on the 46â€“60 Age Group:
Since this group generates the most revenue, targeting them with personalized marketing campaigns could lead to increased sales. Consider offering premium or high-end products for this group, as they may have more disposable income.


- Female-Centric Marketing Initiatives:
With female customers contributing slightly more revenue, consider introducing female-oriented product bundles or offering exclusive discounts.
Focus on product categories that perform well with women, such as beauty and clothing, to drive higher engagement from this demographic.

- Maintain a Balanced Product Strategy:
Since Electronics and Clothing are almost equally strong, your marketing campaigns should maintain a balanced focus between the two. Capitalize on the seasonal trends for these products by launching promotions during peak months (e.g., Electronics and Clothing in May, Beauty in July).


Seasonal Promotions and Inventory Planning:
Electronics and Clothing peak in May, so prepare inventory and promotional campaigns ahead of this time to capitalize on the demand.
Since Beauty spikes in July, consider launching promotions around that time, with a focus on younger audiences who may be more likely to purchase these products.
