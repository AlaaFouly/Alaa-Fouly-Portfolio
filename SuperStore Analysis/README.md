# Superstore Sales Dashboard

## Objective
This dashboard was created to help businesses analyze their sales data and gain actionable insights into product performance, location-based sales, customer segments, and trends over time. It allows decision-makers to make informed choices about inventory, marketing, and sales strategies.

The primary goal is to provide an intuitive, dynamic platform for visualizing key sales metrics and uncovering business opportunities or challenges.

## Key Questions Answered
The dashboard is designed to answer the following important business questions:

### 1. **What is the overall sales and profit performance?**
   - This includes analyzing total sales, total profit, and profit margin percentage to assess the financial health of the business.

### 2. **How does the business perform year-over-year (YoY)?**
   - A key metric in understanding growth or decline trends over the past four years. It helps in identifying periods of growth or loss and areas that need attention.

### 3. **What is the percentage of returned orders, and how has it changed over time?**
   - Understanding the return rate is important for identifying potential issues with product quality, customer satisfaction, or fulfillment processes.

### 4. **How have sales and profits changed compared to the previous year?**
   - By comparing vertical growth (YoY) and horizontal growth (month-over-month), we can gauge seasonal trends and assess whether the business is improving or declining.

### 5. **Which products are the most profitable, and which are losing money?**
   - Helps the company decide which products should be prioritized for promotion or even discontinued. It's vital for inventory and product development decisions.

### 6. **Which locations are contributing the most profit?**
   - Evaluating the performance by region helps to understand which geographic areas are performing well and which may need more attention.

### 7. **How do different customer segments contribute to sales and profit?**
   - By analyzing sales data across different customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office), businesses can tailor marketing strategies and offerings based on segment performance.

## Objectives of Creating the Dashboard

1. **Track Business Growth**:  
   The dashboard helps track both vertical (year-over-year) and horizontal (month-over-month) growth, giving a clear view of how the business is performing over time.

2. **Identify Profitability Trends**:  
   By comparing the profit margin, total sales, and product performance, we can identify which areas of the business are driving profitability and which are underperforming.

3. **Analyze Sales by Region and Segment**:  
   Evaluating the sales data by location and customer segments allows for more granular insights and targeted decision-making.

4. **Monitor Return Rates**:  
   With return rates tracked and compared, the dashboard allows businesses to monitor product quality or customer satisfaction issues. A decrease in return rates is a positive indicator of business and product performance.

5. **Optimize Inventory and Marketing**:  
   With insights into which products are profitable and which are loss-making, inventory and marketing strategies can be optimized, ensuring that resources are directed toward high-performing products and markets.
